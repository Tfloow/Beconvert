## Introduction

This tool serves as an open-source, easy to use and eye catching website to convert your files in various other file types. This is a wrapper around pandoc. I have been using pandoc extensively for the past 2 years and love it. But like ffmpeg, it is the kind of tool that is sitting as a backbone of modern technology yet obfuscated around many layers of code. This is why I wanted to solve this issue with an easy to use all-in-one solution.

## Roadmap

- [x] support markdown to pdf conversion
- [ ] support markdown to any supported file with an appealing selection menu
- [ ] offer word, ... as input
- [ ] offer branding solutions using eisvogel and other pandoc templates
- [ ] offer quote and other business solutions
